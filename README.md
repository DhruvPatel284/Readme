  - Install the backend dependencies:
       ```bash
        npm install
  - Setup the PostgreSQL database:
      - Create a PostgreSQL database and update the connection string in the .env file:
           ```bash
            DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/your-database-name
  - Run the database migrations using Prisma:
       ```bash
        npx prisma migrate dev
  - Add the JWT secret to the .env file:
      ```bash
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
  - Run the backend server:
       ```bash
        npm run dev
3. **Setup Frontend**:
  - Go to the frontend directory:
       ```bash
        cd frontend
  - Go to the frontend directory:
       ```bash
        npm install
  - Setup the backend URL in the config.ts file:
       ```bash
        export const BACKEND_URL = "http://localhost:3000"; // Your local backend URL
  - Run the frontend:
       ```bash
        npm run dev
3. **Setup Frontend**:
  - Open your browser and visit the following URLs:
       - **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000

4. **üìÇ Environment Variables**:
  - You need to set up the following environment variables in your .env file for the backend:
       ```bash
        DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/your-database-name
        JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   - Additionally, update the BACKEND_URL in the frontend's config.ts file for API requests:
       ```bash
        export const BACKEND_URL = "http://localhost:3000"; // Your backend URL
